summary: "National seminar (MIT Rome) talk on IT/OT convergence risks in tram & metro networks."
---

At the **10ᵗʰ National Tram-System Seminar** (Ministry of Infrastructure & Transport, Rome) we outlined how digitalisation, CBTC & SCADA expose rail networks to ransomware, sabotage and supply-chain attacks.  

## Highlights  

* **IT–OT convergence:** wider attack surface; legacy PLCs now reachable via IP.  
* **Threat actors:** state-sponsored APTs, hacktivists, insider threats, cyber-gangs.  
* **Case studies:** Wi-Fi defacement in UK stations (2024), coordinated TGV sabotage pre-Paris Olympics (2024), supply-chain “kill-switch” in Polish rolling-stock (2022).  
* **Controls roadmap:** IEC 62443 zoning, anomaly detection on CAN frames, continuous red-/purple-team drills.
